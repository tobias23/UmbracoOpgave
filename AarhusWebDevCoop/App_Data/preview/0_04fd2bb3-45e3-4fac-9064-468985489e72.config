<p style="text-align: left;"><span>I've seen many and many people saying that after 5 years in a row releasing souls games, there is a genre fatigue, but my opinion is that many are missing the obvious:</span><br /><br /><span>Bloodborne opened the door to a lot of people that didnt even know they liked action rpg! Or even knowned about dark souls!</span><br /><br /><span>In my case, ive heard before about dark souls but never cared too much about, i bought bloodborne at the time cause playstation 4 was missing exclusives and i tought bloodborne was like a horror game ala resident evil( the dogs tricked me in the reveal trailer)</span><br /><br /><span>In the beggining i didnt even know what i was playing, got hooked and since then i want everything similar in that genre.</span><br /><br /><span>I bet theres a lot more like me that most likely only played bloodborne and dark souls 3 , eagger to play another souls game.</span><br /><br /><span>I understand all of you that have been with souls since the beggining, but i hope you understand all the doors bloodborne opened to the genre and new players.</span></p>]]></articleContents>

        <projectDiscription><![CDATA[<p>If there was any doubt over the PS5 existing in the future, there isn't any more. Sony has now officially talked about its next generation console, meaning the barrier holding back the wave of PS5 info might be about to break. In this exhaustive look at the PS5 we will dissect all PS5 rumours so you can see what is wild speculation and what is leaked info. We will try to figure out a likely PS5 release date and consider when Sony will reveal its PS5. Whenever Sony does lift the lid on the PlayStation 5, we'll be sure to update this guide page with all the info. <a data-id="2000952" class="button annotation-count" data-commentable="true" data-fragment="2000952-p-ifthere-theinfo" data-count="0"></a></p>
<h2>PS5 Release Date<a data-id="2000952" class="button annotation-count" data-commentable="true" data-fragment="2000952-h-ps5rele-asedate" data-count="0"></a></h2>
<p>There is no announced PS5 release date. Currently the best you're going to find is analyst predictions on when Sony's next console will launch and journalist speculation or comment. What we do now have is Sony talking about the PS5 for the first time, which is a step towards the full reveal of the console. <a data-id="2000952" class="button annotation-count" data-commentable="true" data-fragment="2000952-p-thereis-console" data-count="0"></a></p>
<p>"At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware," said Kenichiro Yoshida, Sony boss, in an interview with the<span> </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/25f9a068-c898-11e8-ba8f-ee390057b8c9">Financial Times</a><span> </span>in early October. That's not saying much, really, but it is an official comment from Sony that acknowledges the need for a PS5. <a data-id="2000952" class="button annotation-count" data-commentable="true" data-fragment="2000952-p-atthisp-foraps5" data-count="0"></a></p>
<p>If we’re going off claims made by<span> </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/the1099/episode-108-michael-pachter-on-xbox-one-x-sales-the-switchs-future-and-console-exclusives">industry analyst Michael Pachter</a>, the PS5 release date could be as soon as 2020 (Pachter originally claimed 2019 but then revised the date). A new report by<span> </span><a href="http://www.ace-sec.co.jp/daily/analyst/180815r6758.pdf">Ace Securities</a><span> </span>suggests a 2019 release date for PS5 is still possible, but does point to potential manufacturing problems that will mean consoles won't be produced quickly enough. This could lead to a delay into 2020. <a data-id="2000952" class="button annotation-count" data-commentable="true" data-fragment="2000952-p-ifwereg-nto2020" data-count="0"></a></p>
<p><span>All this is obviously theoretical, but it’s always interesting to hear what long-time industry analysts and experts have to say on the future of blockbuster home consoles like the PlayStation 5. We reckon 2019 is a little early for Sony to release the next PlayStation given the strong position it currently holds in the market, with 2020 making far more sense. If Sony is still riding high in 2019, maybe we'll have to wait until 2021. We'll just have to wait and see. </span><a data-id="2000952" class="button annotation-count" data-commentable="true" data-fragment="2000952-p-allthis-tandsee" data-count="0"></a></p>]]></projectDiscription>
